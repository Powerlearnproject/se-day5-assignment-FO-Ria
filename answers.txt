 Radiology App Project

Project Overview

The Radiology App is designed to streamline and enhance radiology services for healthcare professionals and patients. The app aims to facilitate managing, sharing, and analysing radiology images, reports, and patient data in a secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment. This project focuses on developing key features and functionality for the app, ensuring it aligns with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

Features
 1. Image Management
- DICOM Support: The app supports the upload, storage, and viewing of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files.
- Image Viewer: Provides an intuitive interface for zooming, panning, and adjusting the brightness and contrast of images.
- Annotations: Radiologists can add annotations to images for clinical observations and diagnoses.
- Comparison Mode: Ability to compare current and past images for better diagnostic accuracy.
 2. Patient Management
- Patient Profiles: Manage patient demographics, medical history, and past radiology records.
- Secure Access: Role-based access control to ensure patient data is only available to authorized personnel.
- Patient Portal: Patients can securely view their radiology images and reports online.

3. Reporting
- Automated Report Generation: Automatically generate structured radiology reports based on findings.
- Speech-to-Text Support: Radiologists can dictate their observations, which are automatically transcribed into text.
- Template Library: Pre-built report templates for different types of radiology exams.

 4. Collaboration and Sharing
- Peer Collaboration: Radiologists can share cases with peers for second opinions or consultations.
- Telemedicine Integration: Support for remote consultations with specialists.
- Export Options: Export images and reports in various formats (PDF, JPEG, etc.) for external sharing.

 5. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Integration
- Image Analysis: AI algorithms assist in detecting abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, and other pathologies.
- Automated Workflows: AI helps prioritize urgent cases based on the severity of findings.

 6. Compliance and Security
- HIPAA Compliance: The app follows HIPAA regulations to ensure the privacy and security of patient data.
- Encryption: End-to-end encryption for all patient information, images, and reports.
- Audit Logs: Detailed logs of user activity for compliance and security monitoring.

Technology Stack

- Frontend: React Native for mobile app development (iOS/Android).
- Backend: Node.js with Express for API development.
- Database: MongoDB for storing patient data, images, and reports.
- Cloud Storage: AWS S3 for secure and scalable image storage.
- AI Models: TensorFlow for AI-driven image analysis.

User Stories

1. Radiologist
   - As a radiologist, I want to be able to upload and view DICOM images so that I can diagnose patients remotely.
   - As a radiologist, I want to annotate images to highlight areas of concern.
   - As a radiologist, I want to generate reports quickly and share them securely with other healthcare professionals.

2. Patient
   - As a patient, I want to access my radiology images and reports online securely.
   - As a patient, I want to share my images and reports with another doctor if needed.

3. Administrator
   - As an administrator, I want to manage user permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
   - As an administrator, I want to monitor system activity and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

Installation and Setup
